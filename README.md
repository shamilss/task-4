# 📱 Mobile-Friendly Website Conversion

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project demonstrates the process of converting an existing **desktop-only web page** into a **mobile-friendly, responsive website** using **CSS media queries**.  
The design is now adaptable to different screen sizes, ensuring optimal viewing and user experience on **mobile, tablet, and desktop devices**.

## 💻 Technologies Used  
- HTML5  
- CSS3 (Flexbox, Media Queries)  
- JavaScript (for mobile menu toggle)  
- Chrome DevTools (for testing responsiveness)

## 🧩 Features  
- Added **meta viewport tag** for mobile scaling  
- Created **responsive navigation menu** with a hamburger icon for smaller screens  
- Converted fixed-width elements into flexible layouts  
- Stacked columns vertically on smaller viewports  
- Ensured images are **scalable** with `max-width: 100%`  
- Fixed overflow and scrolling issues  
- Responsive contact form and footer

## 📱 Responsiveness  
The layout automatically adjusts based on device width:  
- **Desktop (≥ 1024px)** → Multi-column layout with horizontal navigation  
- **Tablet (768px - 1023px)** → Slightly reduced padding and font sizes  
- **Mobile (≤ 768px)** → Stacked layout, vertical navigation, smaller buttons and text

2. Open the project folder in **VS Code** or any editor of your choice.

4. Install the **Live Server** extension (optional for VS Code).  
5. Right-click `index.html` → **"Open with Live Server"**.
